# NICE Bus Map
This project was started to create an embedded live map of NICE bus.

Site can be viewed here: https://hdcp.github.io/NICEMap/index.html

Things to do:

- Add live data feed (Done)

The URLs can be parsed for the information (it looks like the feeds limit queries to 10 routes or less).
However, due to the NICE website having no CORS policy set, the requests need to go through a proxy.

- Add API key for Google Maps (Done)

- Add Map Legend (Done)

- Correct description windows (Work in Progress)
