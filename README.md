# NICE Bus Map
This project was started to create an embedded live map of NICE bus.

Site can be viewed here: https://hdcp.github.io/NICEMap/index.html

Things to do:

- Add live data feed (Done)

The URLs can be parsed for that information (it looks like the feeds limit queries to 10 routes or less):

- Add API key for Google Maps (Done)
